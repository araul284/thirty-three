> *“It’s not about cars, it’s about curves… graphs, I mean.”*  

Welcome to **thirtytheee**, a beginner-friendly machine learning project exploring Formula 1 data.  
The goal? To analyze, visualize, and make predictions from racing stats — all through the lens of Python, pandas, and a sprinkle of ML magic.  

---

## 🚦 What this repo is about  
- 📂 Working with public F1 datasets  
- 📊 Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with pandas & matplotlib/seaborn  
- 📈 Building simple models to predict race outcomes (e.g., finishing positions, podium chances, or lap time trends)  
- 🧩 Step-by-step learning — written for someone *new* to ML libraries but curious about data storytelling  

---

## 🛠️ Tech stack  
- Python (Google Colab)  
- pandas, numpy  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- scikit-learn  

---

## ✨ Goals  
- Understand the *flow of data* from raw CSV → cleaned dataset → visual insights  
- Create engaging graphs that show patterns in race results  
- Experiment with basic prediction models  
- Share the journey (and maybe inspire other F1 + data fans!)

## 📌 Notes  
This repo is a **learning project**, not a professional ML model.  
Think of it like a test track — fast, messy, but fun. 🚗💨

## 🌟 Status  
Ongoing… still in the pits, tuning up.
